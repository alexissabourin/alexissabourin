👋 hi! i'm currently studying **computer science** at the **university of waterloo** in canada (second year). one thing about me: i build & ship products end-to-end across front end, back end, and infrastructure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> i am actively on the lookout for a **summer 2026** (may - august) software engineering internship anywhere in canada or the united states. i'm open for relocation and remote roles. i'll be happy to chat with you if you have an opportunity at the moment!

⏮️ **previously:** shipped and scaled full-stack systems across fintech and security, modernized UIs for 500+ internal users, migrated Spring Boot APIs and legacy data into MySQL with 85% test coverage, and owned end-to-end incident-platform engineering (APIs, database design, RBAC, audit logging, CI quality gates, and E2E testing). I like owning systems end-to-end, optimizing for reliability and performance, and building products that ship fast
